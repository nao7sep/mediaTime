The negative difference is probably due to FAT32's 2-second resolution thing considering its occurrence with other cameras as well.

Images taken with the DSC-RX100 seem OK, but videos are in the .mts format and are completely unreadable.
Luckily, I didnt like the format and didnt really use the camera for videos.
I only have a few old video files by it and their file system timestamps seem intact.

If I physically take the SD card out of the GoPro and transfer the files to my computer, the file system timestamps are intact.
If I connect the GoPro via USB and transfer the files, the timestamps are set to the actual times of the transfer.

Stores date/time info in local time.
As the camera doesnt automatically adjust its time or timezone (partly due to my settings),
I only have to implement a functionality to auto-suggest the correct timezone and ask the user to confirm it.
Videos taken with the same camera in the same period of time tend to have similar file names.
Even if a few of them have been (accidentally) edited and their file system timestamps arent intact,
considering the rest and the camera's specifications, the user can easily and correctly make the right choice.

The 70D stores date/time info in local time and stores the model info as well.
The M6, which is about 4 years more recent, uses UTC and doesnt store the model info.

The Alpha series are highly sophisticated cameras with users in many countries.
If one of them stores date/time info in UTC,
it's probably the right thing to set "Created" and "Modified" in QuickTime's metadata in UTC,
meaning older cameras that dont just werent implemented properly.

Digged very old videos.
Assuming it's by the 5D considering that I didnt have the 70D back then and the similarities of the file names.
